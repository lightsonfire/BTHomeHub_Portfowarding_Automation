BTHomeHub_Portfowarding_Automation
==================================

"A Freeware project that allows people who own a homehub to automatically portfoward, easily and free of charge."

If you've ever been to the portfowarding.com website you will know that they are notrious for charging people to use
there program to allow you to automate portfowarding on your router. Where as it can be quite simple and easy to learn
how to port foward I decided that it would be easyier to create my own script / GUI and the best part of it is that
it will be freeware and ANYONE can use my software.

Thanks.
